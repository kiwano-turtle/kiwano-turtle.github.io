 <p>Living in a food desert can be quite the experience. Already limited, trying to find sustainable food can be expensive and hard to find. Below are some tips and resources to allow you to have an easier time finding more sustanaible solutions.<p>
<p>Buying non perishable, canned food in bulk is a great way to always have food avaialable. By buying canned food, you can control what you eat and make sure everything is healthy and always readily available. Another way is to make and start a community garden. This does't have to be a big garden, but just big enough for your needs. Go to the local grocery market and start planting. Sooner or later you will have plenty of food and vegetables you can choose from, and will be a great way to always keep food readily available. <p>
<p> You can also consult small startups and other organisations for sustanibility solutions and ideas. Some examples are linked below: <p>
